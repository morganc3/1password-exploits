\i \cf2 Pngquant
\i0 \
\
The quantization and dithering code in pngquant is lifted from Jef Poskanzer's\
'ppmquant', part of his wonderful PBMPLUS tool suite.\
\
Greg Roelofs hacked it into a (in his words) "slightly cheesy" 'pamquant' back\
in 1997 (see http://pobox.com/~newt/greg_rgba.html) and finally he ripped out\
the cheesy file-I/O parts and replaced them with nice PNG code in December\
2000. The PNG reading and writing code is a merged and slightly simplified\
version of readpng, readpng2, and writepng from his book:\
\
   "PNG: The Definitive Guide."\
\
Pngquant therefore inherits both licenses, one for each source file.\
\
Note that both licenses are basically BSD-like; that is, use the code however\
you like, as long as you acknowledge its origins.\
